"6","Logan, UT - Prosecutors have added rape and sodomy charges against the uncle of a 5-year-old girl whose remains were found after she went missing late last month in Utah.

Elizabeth Shelley's mother last saw her on May 25 at 2 a.m. at their home in western Logan, according to Police Capt. Tyson Budge. That was also the last time her family saw suspect Alex Whipple, who'd visited the girl's home that Friday night.

Whipple was charged with aggravated murder and other charges last month, and the Cache County Attorney's Office announced Wednesday that it has received additional evidence since the filing of the original charges.

""This information led to the filing of two additional charges against Alex Whipple in the disappearance and murder of 5-year-old Elizabeth Shelley. These charges are rape of a child, a first degree felony and sodomy upon a child, also a first degree felony,"" the Cache County Attorney's Office said.

Prosecutors are awaiting a cause of death from the Utah office of the medical examiner.

Whipple, 21, has been the main suspect in the girl's disappearance. He was also charged with a count of child kidnapping, two counts of obstruction of justice and a count of desecration of a body, authorities said.

Suspect told authorities where to search

Investigators found Elizabeth's remains after the suspect provided a map of an area that authorities searched, police said.

""We certainly wanted to bring Lizzy home,"" Logan City Police Chief Gary Jensen said.

Whipple's attorney said his client gave information to authorities. ""He felt it would be appropriate to disclose the location of the body,"" attorney Shannon Demler said, indicating the location was close to the girl's home.

Death penalty taken off the table

Jensen said that a deal was reached with the Cache County Attorney's Office to take the death penalty off the table in exchange for information that would lead to the girl's body.

Whipple had been drinking and playing video games with Elizabeth's mother and her live-in boyfriend the night before the girl was reported missing, according to court documents filed in Cache County.

The suspect, located by police hours after Elizabeth vanished, gave investigators conflicting versions of his whereabouts the previous night, the documents said. At one point, he left a police interview room and ""began licking his hands"" and trying to wipe them clean.

Whipple eventually admitted being at Elizabeth's home and told police he went on a walk to ""enjoy the scenery"" after his sister and boyfriend went to their room, according to the documents. Again, investigators discovered inconsistencies in his time line.

Suspect talks about 'evil' in the world

During the interview with police, the documents said, the suspect referred to the ""evil"" in the world and his ""struggles as a child and how his family has treated him horribly throughout his life.""

Whipple told police that alcohol makes him ""black out"" and that ""he sometimes does 'criminal things' when he blacks out,"" the documents said. There were dark stains consistent with blood on his pants and cuts on his hands.

Investigators searching for the girl later discovered a broken, blood-stained knife that was missing from her mother's kitchen and a PVC pipe with a partial, bloodied palm print, according to the documents.

Not far away, police found the teal skirt with white lace that Elizabeth had been wearing buried beneath dirt and bark. The skirt was stained with blood. A small concrete block nearby also was stained with blood.

The blood on the suspect's clothing, his watch and the knife were matched to Elizabeth during a DNA test, the documents said. The palm print on the pipe was matched to the suspect.

Whipple was arrested on a warrant for probation violation and was ordered held without bail, according to CNN affiliate KSTU."

"8","Amesbury, MA - A Massachusetts man accused of giving drugs to a 13-year-old girl and then dropping her off at a hospital where she soon died was charged Tuesday with aggravated rape of a child, prosecutors said.

Carlos Rivera, 47, was in court for a dangerousness hearing when he was instead arraigned on the rape charge following new evidence in the death of the girl. Preliminary results from an autopsy on the 13-year-old linked Rivera's DNA to her, the Essex District Attorney's Office said.

Rivera, who was arrested on May 25, was arraigned last week on two counts of distribution of cocaine to a minor, two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under 14, and one count of indecent assault and battery on a person 14 or over.

The district attorney's office said last week that Rivera was also accused of indecently assaulting another girl, who is 16. That alleged assault was discovered during the investigation regarding the 13-year-old.

Detectives said he left the 13-year-old at Lawrence General Hospital on May 20. She died shortly after arriving. The cause and manner of her death have not yet been revealed, the district attorney's office said.

According to investigators, Rivera was accompanied by another girl, who was under 16, when he dropped off the 13-year-old at the hospital. Detectives said both girls were at Rivera's apartment prior to the 13-year-old's death.

The 13-year-old girl's mother told the Boston Globe that she dropped her daughter off at a friend's house in Amesbury and became worried when she had not heard from her. After texting some of her daughter's friends, the mother said she learned that the girl had been taken to the hospital.

"9","East New York, NY - A Brooklyn man accused of raping his 88-year-old neighbor told cops he didn’t sexually assault the woman — he just tied her up and took off her clothes, according to newly unsealed court documents.

“I didn’t have sex with her,” Selwyn Worrell told officers during a rambling statement following his April arrest. “I never raped that lady. I just tied her up and I took her shirt off, that’s it. I just wanted her not to move.”

Worrell pleaded not guilty Monday to various charges, including rape and burglary, for the East New York home invasion. The elderly woman survived the attack, and was rescued after activating her Life Alert necklace.

The 24-year-old originally told cops he didn’t know the victim, but then admitted he’d known the octogenarian his “whole life.”

He said he “blacked out” after smoking weed, and stole a gold watch, and later remembers suddenly being in the basement and hearing her scream.

“I didn’t hit the lady,” Worrell raved. “She was screaming because when I grabbed her I had my hand around her neck, I don’t remember hitting that lady, man. I tied her with tape. I started searching through her s–t.”

He ends the tirade saying: “I’ll go upstate and kill myself.”

Worrell is due back in court July 30. He faces up to 25 years behind bars if convicted."
"10","Los Angeles, CA (AP) —The leader and self-proclaimed apostle of La Luz del Mundo, a Mexico-based church with branches in the U.S. that claims over 1 million followers, has been charged with human trafficking and child rape, California officials announced Tuesday.

Joaquín García and a follower of the church, 24-year-old Susana Medina Oaxaca, were arrested Monday after landing at Los Angeles International Airport, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra's office said.

Around 1,000 worshippers gathered at the headquarters of La Luz del Mundo in Guadalajara, Jalisco, on Tuesday evening to pray for García as he was held in Los Angeles on $25 million bail.

García, 50, faces 26 counts of felony charges that range from human trafficking and production of child pornography to forcible rape of a minor. The charges detail a series of disturbing allegations involving three girls and one woman between 2015 and 2018 in Los Angeles County.

The fundamentalist Christian church, whose name translates to The Light of the World, was founded in 1926 by García's grandfather. It has been the subject of child sex abuse allegations for years but authorities in Mexico have never filed criminal charges. It has more than 15,000 churches in 58 countries, according to its website. The church's followers must adhere to a strict moral code in exchange for the promise of eternal salvation.

García - who was a minister in Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California before becoming the church's leader - coerced the victims into performing sex acts by telling them that refusing would be going against God, authorities said. He allegedly forced the victims, who were members of the church, to sexually touch themselves and each other. One of his co-defendants also allegedly took nude photographs of the victims and sent the pictures to García.

García told one of the victims and others in 2017, after they had completed a ""flirty"" dance wearing ""as little clothing as possible"" that kings can have mistresses and an apostle of God cannot be judged for his actions, the complaint states.

""Crimes like those alleged in this complaint have no place in our society. Period,"" Becerra said in a press release. ""We must not turn a blind eye to sexual violence and trafficking in our state.""

The attorney general's investigation began in 2018, prompted in part by a tip to the state's Department of Justice through an online clergy abuse complaint form.

David Correa, a spokesman from the church's headquarters, said in a phone call that they learned about the charges from the media.

""We categorically deny those false accusations,"" Correa said. ""We know him personally and he is an honorable and honest man.""

Church officials said García has always behaved lawfully and rejected the attorney general's charges.

The church's statement Tuesday said they hoped the accusations would not lead to discrimination and religious intolerance against its followers.

A third follower, Alondra Ocampo, 36, was arrested in Los Angeles County and is being held at the sheriff's Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood ahead of her arraignment Wednesday in Los Angeles. A fourth defendant, Azalea Rangel Melendez, remains at large.

It wasn't immediately clear whether the defendants had an attorney.

In May, an opera concert at Palacio de Bellas Artes, the main cultural venue in Mexico, generated controversy because in some places it was presented as a tribute to García. Critics said a secular state such as Mexico shouldn't use a public place for that purpose.

The work, ""The Guardian of the Mirror,"" was broadcast on social networks and screened outside the Palace, with the church's followers in the audience.

La Luz del Mundo denied that it was an homage and said the opinions expressed in social networks were not promoted by the institution.

Airport police referred media inquiries to Customs and Border Patrol, which did not immediately have a comment."
"11","Netherlands,  - A 17-year-old girl who wrote a book about her struggle with mental illness after being molested and raped has died after requesting to be legally euthanized in the Netherlands, according to reports.

Initial reports claimed Noa Pothoven chose to end her life Sunday with the assistance of an end of life clinic, which has been legal in the Netherlands since 2002.

But it is unclear whether she died because doctors directly intervened, or if she refused to eat.

A spokesman for Lisa Westerveld, a Dutch member of parliament, told the website DutchNews.nl Wednesday that she was one of the people invited to say goodbye to her before she passed away, adding, ""as far as we know, she died because she didn't eat any more"".

The teen from Amhem suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anorexia after being molested when she was 11 and 12 and raped by two men when she was 14, The Sun reported.

In an Instagram post written on the day before her death, which has since been deleted, she wrote: “Maybe this comes as a surprise to some, given my posts about hospitalization, but my plan has been there for a long time and is not impulsive.”

Noa said she had been fighting for years and was now “drained,” and that she felt she had never been alive but was instead just “surviving.”

 “I have quit eating and drinking for a while now, and after many discussions and evaluations, it was decided to let me go because my suffering is unbearable,” Pothoven wrote, according to Inside Edition. “Love is letting go, in this case.”

She reported the attacks to police last year, and wrote about her struggles in a memoir ""Winning and Learning.

The initial news that she had chosen to end her life by euthanasia drew a response from the Vatican.

Pope Francis, on Wednesday morning, tweeted: ""Euthanasia and assisted suicide are a defeat for all. We are called never to abandon those who are suffering, never giving up but caring and loving to restore hope."""
"12","Fort Lauderdale, FL — The Broward Sheriff’s Office needs help locating a murder suspect who was released from jail when he should not have been.

Eric Vail, 28, was being held at the county jail on a second-degree murder charge but on Thursday, the jail was told that that charge against Vail was dismissed and he was released.

The Sheriff’s Office, which denies it did anything wrong, is now trying to get him back in custody.

“On Thursday, the Broward Sheriff’s Office received unequivocal direction from the State Attorney’s Office that the second degree murder charge on Eric Vail had been dismissed.  We did not have and have not yet located any documentation stating the subject was to be held on another charge.  Our main priority at this time is to locate and apprehend this dangerous criminal,” according to a statement from BSO.

In an updated statement from the Broward State Attorney’s Office released Monday monring, they claim no wrongdoing.

“After speaking again with the Sheriff’s Office this morning, we are confident that the State Attorney’s Office correctly followed all procedures and provided the relevant paperwork through the proper channels.”

Vail had been in the jail since January, accused of being the trigger man in the death of 27-year-old Wadarius Harris in October of last year.

Police say Vail used an AK-47 in the shooting, which was a result of an ongoing feud.

Vail originally was arrested on a second-degree murder charge, but a grand jury indicted him and a suspected accomplice, Christopher Avery Campbell with first-degree murder in April.

An earlier statement from the State Attorney’s Office read, “The second-degree murder charge was initially filed on Jan. 29. The grand jury subsequently indicted the defendant on the first-degree murder charge on April 3. The defendant was arraigned on the more serious charge on April 9.  The defendant was taken to court by the Sheriff’s Office on the first-degree murder charge on Thursday so it’s hard to know how the Sheriff’s Office didn’t know about the first-degree murder charge.  Our office kept the second-degree murder charge open for over 50 days after the indictment on the other charge was filed in court.”

Vail had two cases in Broward Circuit Court, one from his January arrest and the second based on the April grand jury indictment.

On Thursday, Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer closed the original case since it involved the same matter as the April charge.

Despite the continuing second case, which Scherer is also overseeing, Vail was released from jail that same day, jail officials said.

Anyone with information on his whereabouts should contact Broward Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS."

Japheth Kessio and his wife couldn’t believe it when they saw the headline on Monday that a murder happened right next door.

“Just to know that something like that happened in your immediate neighborhood is terrible. It’s a shock,” he said.

It happened in the middle of the night so the Kessios and other neighbors were asleep. They didn’t see or hear anything.

The Madison County Sheriff’s Office responded to the scene on Lady Slipper Bend around 2 AM Sunday after receiving a 911 call from someone at the house about a shooting.

Darin Schilmiller, of New Salisbury, has now been indicted alongside five others in relation to the killing of 19-year-old Cynthia Hoffman (pictured on right)  on June 2. He allegedly posed under the name ""Tyler"" and offered 18-year-old Denali Brehmer $9 million to orchestrate the murder.

According to prosecutors, the brutal proposal sparked a devastating series of events that has also resulted in the arrest of Kayden McIntosh 16, Caleb Leyland, 19, and two minors.

Hoffman, who is referred to as ""CeeCee"" in court filings—was killed in Thunderbird Falls close to the Eklutna River from a single gunshot wound to the back of the head. Officials allege Brehmer and McIntosh drove Hoffman to the area, where she was bound. McIntosh allegedly shot Hoffman before moving her body into the river. The pair destroyed some of the victim's items.

Prosecutors say Brehmer recruited McIntosh, Leyland and the minors to assist in the planning or execution of the murder. Schilmiller allegedly wanted Brehmer to sent him videos or photos of the killing. In exchange, he claimed the teens ""would receive a significant sum of money.""

Hoffman was reported missing by a family member on June 3 after being provided misleading information by the culprits, police said. The victim was described as Brehmer's best friend.

According to local media outlet KTVA, detectives found pornography, SMS texts and footage of sexual assaults on Brehmer's phone that led them to Schilmiller. The FBI traced a number on the device and found it was linked to a Facebook account used by the 21-year-old man.

The Anchorage Daily News reported Brehmer sent images and videos to Schilmiller via Snapchat showing Hoffman tied up before her death, and others were sent after the killing.

KTVA reported that Brehmer told investigators she met Schilmiller online and they had been chatting for several months. He was using a photograph of another male, police said. Brehmer claimed the man also directed her to assault a young child and a 15-year-old.

The assaults took place the the day after Hoffman's death at the behest of Schilmiller, who told police that he blackmailed her, The Anchorage Daily News reported, citing the indictment.

The victim's father, Timothy Hoffman, told the newspaper his daughter had a developmental disability and was vulnerable. ""Her disability just made her want to have friends. That's all she wanted, was just to be her friend,"" he said in comments that were first reported on June 8.

Court documents said: ""Interviews and recovered cell phone evidence reveals that during the course of Schilmiller's and Brehmer's relationship, and several weeks before Hoffman's murder, the two began discussing a plan to rape and murder someone in Alaska.""

The six indicted individuals have now been charged with murder in the first degree, conspiracy to commit murder in the first degree and two counts of murder in the second degree.

Schilmiller and Brehmer were also indicted on one count of solicitation to commit murder in the first degree. Brehmer was further indicted on a count of tampering with physical evidence and McIntosh was indicted on four counts of evidence tampering.

If convicted at trial, the defendants face a sentence of up to 99 years imprisonment for each of the murder charges.

Brehmer and McIntosh face up to five years imprisonment for each of the tampering with physical evidence charges. Schilmiller, who is being extradited to Alaska, is currently in the custody of the FBI. Brehmer, McIntosh and Leyland are in the custody of the state's Department of Corrections and are set to be arraigned today."
"22","Seattle, WA - A 35-year-old White Center man who was recently released from the King County Jail after serving time for rape is now accused of tracking down the victim last weekend, pushing her out of her wheelchair and strangling and beating her in front of her young son, according to prosecutors.

Francisco Carranza-Ramirez was supposed to board a flight to California and return to his native Mexico on Monday after King County Superior Court Judge Nicole Gaines Phelps agreed not to impose community custody, or probation, following his release from jail last week, court records show. He is now wanted on a no-bail warrant for violating conditions of his release on the rape charge, according to court records and King County sheriff’s spokesman Sgt. Ryan Abbott.

Carranza-Ramirez was charged Tuesday with second-degree assault, felony harassment, intimidating a witness and felony violation of a sexual-assault protection order in connection with the attack on the victim, court records show. Each of those charges include a rapid-recidivism allegation, which, if proven, would allow prosecutors to potentially seek an exceptional sentence because the most recent crimes were allegedly committed three days after Carranza-Ramirez was released from jail.

The 32-year-old victim, who is partially paralyzed and uses a wheelchair, suffered numerous cuts and bruises, as well as a seizure and concussion after being strangled and struck in the head during the attack just after 9 p.m. Sunday outside her White Center apartment building, the most recent charges say. She told detectives she is terrified of Carranza-Ramirez, a man she didn’t know when he raped her last fall, and is worried he will return to kill her, say the charges.

Abbott, the sheriff’s spokesman, said Tuesday that after the woman was released from the hospital, she was moved along with her 3-year-old son and her service dog to a safe location outside of the White Center area.

“We’re hoping someone recognizes him,” Abbott said of Carranza-Ramirez, who is homeless and still believed to be in White Center.

Carranza-Ramirez is described as 5 feet 8 inches tall, 140 pounds with a medium skin tone, brown eyes and long black hair. He has previously worn a beard and mustache but it’s unknown if he is still sporting facial hair. Anyone with information of his whereabouts is asked to call 911.

According to court records:

Over two days in September, Carranza-Ramirez approached the victim in her neighborhood and engaged her in small talk. Then on Sept. 26, the woman and her toddler son went to get their mail and Carranza-Ramirez suddenly appeared at the apartment mailboxes, then followed the woman into her apartment uninvited. Due to her disability, the woman later told detectives she didn’t scream for help because she was concerned for her son’s safety.

Carranza-Ramirez raped the woman in her bedroom but during the attack, she convinced him she needed to use the bathroom, the charges say. She called 911 and asked for help; when she heard Carranza-Ramirez get up from the bed, she tucked the phone with the line still open in her wheelchair and returned to the bedroom, where the rape continued, charging papers say.

The dispatcher heard the woman say “Stop” and “I’ll be quiet.” Deputies responded, entered the apartment and interrupted the sexual assault, say the charges. Carranza-Ramirez was arrested at the scene and subsequently charged with third-degree rape.

Carranza-Ramirez entered an Alford plea during his February arraignment, admitting a jury would likely find him guilty.

In a victim-impact statement, the victim wrote that she was terrorized during the rape, questioned why he wasn’t charged with a more serious crime and begged the judge to impose the most severe sentence possible."
"23","Bronx, NY - A black parolee arrested for raping and bashing a white woman on the roof of his Bronx apartment building allegedly told a witness that she “deserved” the brutal attack because of slavery, according to court papers.

“She was a white girl. She deserved it because us minorities have been through slavery,” Temar Bishop, 23, allegedly said to someone who witnessed the bloodied 20-year-old woman after the assaults, according to a criminal complaint.

“This is what they used to do to us. This is what they did to us during slavery. They used to beat us and whip us.”

Temar Bishop, 23, was arrested by authorities on Friday in Virginia on a slew of charges connected to the early morning June 1 assault, which officials have deemed a hate crime, according to authorities.

The 20-year-old met Bishop — who was on parole after serving just over a year behind bars for robbery — around 5 a.m. and joined him on the rooftop of the public housing building on Alexander Avenue near East 137th Street in Mott Haven, police said.

Bishop allegedly punched her repeatedly before raping her, then continued his assault — kicking and punching her in the head and body until she fell unconscious, cops said.He then fled, but returned with the unnamed witness — who saw the woman “laying on the roof landing with blood covering her face” — and then allegedly made the remarks about slavery, court documents say.

The woman was treated at an area hospital for several injuries, including a broken nose and broken teeth. She was also “vomiting blood,” the complaint states.

Police sources previously told The Post a Special Victims Division investigator described the attack as “one of the worst he’s ever seen.”

Bishop was charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault, attempted murder, rape, two counts of assault, sexual abuse, assault and a hate crime.

He was arraigned in Bronx court on Saturday, where he was ordered held without bail, a spokeswoman for the Bronx District attorney’s office said."
"24","South Carolina,  USA – A South Carolina father who killed his five children should be executed, a jury has agreed, ignoring a court plea for mercy from the victims' mother.

Amber Kyzer said on Tuesday convicted murderer Tim Jones Jr, 37, ""did not show my children mercy by any means, but my kids loved him"".

The sentence came after prosecutors argued that life in prison would be like sending ""Timmy to his room"".

South Carolina has not executed an inmate since 2011.

Thursday's unanimous decision was reached by the same jury that convicted Jones of the August 2014 slaying of the five children, aged one to eight.

Had the Lexington County panel of seven men and five women been unable to reach a unanimous decision, Jones would have been sentenced to life in prison.

The jurors agreed his fate after about two hours of deliberation on the 21st day of the trial.

During sentencing arguments, prosecutors asked jurors to recall the shocking manner of the murders.

Jones admitting exercising his oldest child as a punishment until he collapsed and died.

He strangled the other four, before driving aimlessly around for nine days with the bodies in his car, dumping the remains in black bin bags in rural Alabama.

Jones drove around aimlessly for nine days with the children's bodies in his car

During the trial, Jones' father, stepmother, sister and two brothers all took the stand to ask that he be given life without parole.

Jones' father removed his shirt to show the courtroom tattoos of his slain grandchildren.

Ms Kyzer also requested mercy for her ex-husband.

""He did not show my children any mercy by any means,"" she said. ""But my kids loved him and if I'm speaking on behalf of my kids and not myself, that's what I have to say."""
"25","Norwalk, CT – For years, Marc Karun unnerved neighbors in the small New England town where he lived in a log home that was surrounded by acres of thick woods and couldn’t be seen from the road.

The Connecticut native had shown up in Stetson, Maine, a rural community of roughly 1,200 people, in 2013. Right away, residents told the Bangor Daily News, he began to exhibit peculiar behavior. He would stand at the top of his driveway and salute passing drivers for no apparent reason, show up at town meetings to make snarky comments, and walk around with a blank stare that left some uneasy. It was well known that he was a lifetime registrant on Maine’s sex-offender registry, with an anonymous vandal painting the word “pedophile” in red on the road outside his home one summer.

So when the white-haired 53-year-old was arrested on Wednesday in connection with the brutal 1986 murder and sexual assault of an 11-year-old girl, residents weren’t exactly shocked to see yellow crime-scene tape blocking off his long driveway.

 “I’m not surprised,” Millard Butler, a town selectman who lived a little over a mile down the road, told the Daily News. “He always acted kind of weird anyway.”

Detectives in Norwalk, Conn., had also been harboring suspicions about Karun — for more than 30 years.

On the afternoon of Sept. 23, 1986, Kathleen Flynn left school and began walking home on a paved footpath that cut through a wooded area, the same route that she took every day. Several hours later, her mother called to report her missing. The sixth-grader’s body was found in the woods early the next morning, not far from the path she had taken home and the athletic fields where soccer and field hockey teams had been playing when she disappeared. She had been raped and strangled.

At the time, Karun was living within a few miles of the school. He had previously been convicted of sexual assault and was questioned within weeks of the murder. Though he denied having anything to do with the crime, he also made a bizarre admission. Four days before Kathleen was killed, he claimed, he had gone to her middle school to “see some teachers.” He described visiting the school’s library and talking with a librarian, and walking around on the same footpath that the sixth-grader had taken, according to a police affidavit obtained by WCSH.

But when police went to the middle school, none of the librarians remembered seeing Karun. The only teachers who recognized his photo were those who knew him as a former student with “serious problems,” according to the affidavit. When questioned about the discrepancy, Karun said that he hadn’t actually been at the school that day.

About eight months before Kathleen was murdered, Karun was arrested on sexual assault and kidnapping charges that were later downgraded after the victim decided that she didn’t want to testify against him in court. Authorities noticed similarities between the two cases, according to court records obtained by the Daily News. Forensic testing didn’t establish a link, but it also didn’t definitively rule out Karun as a suspect.

As police chased down countless leads that turned out to be dead ends, the unsolved murder left the community on edge.

“The kids in school were all terrified, as was everyone in the neighborhood,” Enes Drake, a substitute teacher who lived near the middle school, told the Connecticut Post. “We were all on high alert. The guy was never caught, so we were always looking over their shoulders.”

Detectives would return to Karun again and again in the decades that followed. Two people who knew him — a friend and the victim from the 1986 sexual assault case — separately told police that they also remembered him talking about visiting Kathleen’s middle school. But in the version that they both heard, he had been there on the day of the murder. Still, aside from those comments, nothing directly linked him to the case.

Meanwhile, Karun began accumulating a lengthy rap sheet in Connecticut, including multiple convictions for first-degree sexual assault, according to the Hartford Courant. In 1989, he was ordered to register as a sex offender for life.

As he cycled in and out of prison, police kept trying to crack the case, hoping that advances in DNA technology would eventually lead them to a suspect. Authorities haven’t said yet how they finally zeroed in on Karun, but plan to release more details at a news conference at a later date. An affidavit obtained by WCSH suggests that DNA sampling helped make the match. Police also noted similarities between Kathleen’s murder and the details of four past cases in which Karun faced kidnapping or sexual assault charges, according to the Daily News.

The arrest came nearly a year after Kathleen’s father, Jim, died, the Courant reported. In a statement, the family thanked the Norwalk Police Department “for bringing Kathleen’s murderer to justice” and asked for privacy.

Often, arrests in decades-old cold cases lead to shock and dismay as the suspect’s friends, neighbors and co-workers learn that the person they thought they knew was hiding a dark secret. In Stetson, that wasn’t the case. Neighbors who asked not to be identified told WABI that they “always got kind of a creepy vibe” from Karun and were glad to hear that he was in custody.

“He made all of us uncomfortable,” Catherine Fisher, who works as the town registrar and handled Karun’s car registration every year, told the Daily News. “He would come in, and it’s almost like he looks right through you. He didn’t know when to leave.”

Butler, the selectman, recalled that Karun almost always showed up to the town meetings that take place twice a month. At one recent meeting, a woman became uncomfortable because the registered sex offender, who was seated in the front row, kept staring at her through dark sunglasses, he told the Daily News. She asked Butler to stay behind after the meeting ended and make sure that she got home safely.

“Most of the time, when you hear about someone doing something like this, you think, ‘I guess I knew that person, I didn’t think he was really capable of doing it,'” Butler told WCSH. “But in this case, what I’ve seen of him, I’m not surprised a bit. I think he was completely capable of doing something like that.”"
"26","Carlsbad, CA - A Carlsbad man accused of drugging and sexually assaulting four women, including a 16-year-old girl he met online, pleaded not guilty in a Vista courtroom Wednesday.

Michael Fangman, 47, was taken into custody on Friday when investigators served a search warrant at his home in Carlsbad.

He faces 14 felony charges in connection with the alleged teenage victim, Jane Doe 1, including contacting a minor with intent to commit a sexual offense, providing narcotics (heroine), and unlawful sex and oral copulation with a minor, according to Deputy District Attorney Benjamin Barlow.

Prosecutors believe Fangman had contact with Jane Doe 1 between March 11 and March 16.

An investigation was launched on March 18 when the teenager reported the assault to the Carlsbad Police Department. 

The three other charges stem from an incident with a Jane Doe 2 believed to have occurred on March 30. Fangman faces forcible rape, forcible penetration and sexual battery charges related to that alleged incident, Barlow said.

Prosecutors believe all of the alleged crimes occurred in Carlsbad.

Barlow added that charges related to Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 could come later, as the investigation is still ongoing.

Police say all of Fangman's alleged victims were contacted online. NBC 7 learned Fangman coached travel softball teams for girls 16 and younger and 14 and younger in 2016.

Detectives say they found three other victims who had allegedly been sexually assaulted by Fangman.

 “All of our victims we’re contacted online, via social media outlets, they don’t all share the same one necessarily but he contacted them via online outlets,” said Sgt. Reid Shipley with Carlsbad police.

Shipley said all four victims were from Southern California with one from Orange County. All cases are from the last two years, he said.

The three additional victims are near the ages of 20 and 21 years old, he said.

“I have significant concern both for our own victims as well as any other potential victims that are out there,"" the sergeant added. ""I really want our victims to understand that they’re not alone, that there are other people there and that we really want them to contact us.”

Fangman was booked into the Vista Detention Facility and is being held without bail. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for June 25. If convicted on all charges, Fangman could face up to 25 years in prison.

Jamal Davis was first arrested in late May, and police have been looking for other victims since then. Authorities said they found one victim who is 3 years old.

Police said the molestation of the 3-year-old boy has been going on for a year.

Cocoa Police detectives said Davis knows the child's mother.

According to authorities, the woman did not know what had been going on, but police said the little boy was able to describe to them the illegal acts and who did them.

Police arrested Davis Wednesday while he was in jail, because of a similar arrest.

In that case, a Palm Bay police report said Davis spoke to another child's mother and told her he has a ""weird fetish"" that entails a sexual attraction to girls as young as 3 years old.

In the report, Davis is accused of propositioning her and saying he wanted to perform illegal acts on her son while the she watched.

Police said Davis admitted to recording his acts on his phone. Davis was charged with rape and child pornography in the first incident.

In the second case, authorities said the 3-year-old victim told them pictures were taken of him; Davis is charged with rape.

If convicted, Davis could face life in prison for either or both cases. Police are still investigating whether there are any other victims."

Jurors told the judge during the deliberations they were unable to agree, and Sullivan's lawyers argued Wednesday the judge ""forced"" jurors to keep deliberating, sending the message that a life sentence ""was unacceptable.""

Deborah Jane Martin, 43, was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of David Martin, 72, and Anne Martin, 71, early Saturday in the home they shared in suburban Chicago.

Her mom had called 911 during the attack — with the call catching her dying moans and gasps for air, prosecutor Lorna Amado-Chevlin said, calling it “bone-chilling,” according to the Chicago Tribune.

“No, Debbie!” the mom, a retired school teacher, gasped during the call, the prosecutor told Martin’s first court hearing Monday, according to the paper.

Paramedics found the parents “beyond medical attention” when they arrived at the Arlington Heights home, with the dad’s throat slashed, the Tribune said.

Martin was the only other person in the house, and her hair was wet as if she had just showered, the prosecutor told Martin’s hearing.

Police then found a journal detailing her chilling plans to kill her parents — as well as a Smith & Wesson knife with a 6-inch blade, according to the local Daily Herald.

Arlington Heights police Cmdr. Joseph Pinnello told the Tribune that his force had “dealt with the family over several years in the past but there was no reported violence.”

“It’s hard to determine what persuaded Deborah to take action against her parents at that particular time,” he told the paper.

Michael Begin, 20, pleaded guilty in January to 20 counts of level 4 felony child molestation related to victims he had encountered while overseeing or working with children at Thomas Jefferson Elementary School and the Clark County YMCA between January and October 2017.

Begin was ultimately charged with 27 counts of level 1 felony child molestation, but the plea agreement amended those to 20 — one for each of the victims. Because he'd pleaded guilty, the charges aren't able to be appealed, only the sentence.

On April 26, after hearing from family members of eight of the children, Clark County Circuit Court No. 1 Judge Andrew Adams passed down the maximum sentence of 120 years, but with the final 20 to be served on probation.

"32","Detroit, MI – A Detroit man whom police have called a person of interest in the possible serial rape and murder of three women on the city’s east side has been arrested and charged with a separate assault.

Wayne County prosecutors arrested Deangelo Martin, a 34-year-old homeless man with no violent crimes on his criminal record, and are charging him with criminal sexual conduct and assault with intent to murder.

Those charges stem from a May 7 stabbing and sex assault of a 26-year-old woman in an east side home. The victim fought for her life and was able to escape, police said.

Martin will be arraigned in 36th District Court on Monday. Police Chief James Craig said today that Martin is being treated as a suspect in their ongoing investigation into a suspected serial killer targeting sex workers in Detroit. However, he has not yet been charged with any of those fatal crimes.

“We believe this suspect is tied into all the crimes,” Craig said. “We’re confident he is connected to all the victims we described.”

Martin was taken into custody June 7, two days after the body of a woman was found in a vacant house on Mack Avenue.

The bodies of the other two women were discovered in separate empty dwellings earlier this year. The first on Coventry Street on March 19 and the second on Linhurst Street on May 20. Investigators previously said they believe all three deaths are related. All three victims tied to the possible serial killer were women in their early 50s.

Police also believe Martin may be linked to a separate June 3 attack on a female in her 50s at the same vacant home on Mack Avenue, but the victim was also able to escape. Both survivors are cooperating with police.

"33","Charleston, WV — A student allowed to stay at Marshall University in West Virginia after a conviction for attacking a female student on campus in 2016 is now facing charges of sexually assaulting two more women, court documents show.

Joseph Chase Hardin, 22, has been indicted on second-degree sexual assault charges involving two women stemming from September and October 2018 incidents, according to court records filed Thursday. Hardin was jailed the following day, accused of violating probation for the earlier case in which he was accused of raping a student in her dorm room in February 2016.

A court hearing is scheduled Wednesday on the probation matter.

Hardin was originally charged with sexual assault in the 2016 case though he ultimately entered a Kennedy plea to a lesser charge of battery, allowing him to be convicted without admitting guilt. He was sentenced to a year in jail but the sentence was suspended and he was given three years' probation.

His court-appointed lawyer, Kerry A. Nessel, said he is representing Hardin for his probation case but said it was unclear who would be his lawyer for the assault charges. Nessel said he doesn't know Hardin and declined to comment further.

An ongoing federal lawsuit filed by the woman against the university describes a botched disciplinary process after the alleged 2016 rape as well as a pattern of harassment by Hardin. It says Hardin's continued attendance at Marshall forced the first victim to leave the college.

After the woman reported the attack, the college expelled Hardin but he was allowed to remain on campus during an appeal process. The college didn't place any restrictions that would prevent the woman from encountering Hardin, according to the lawsuit. The suit also says that in one instance, Hardin wore one of her headbands at a basketball game to mock her and that his friends taunted her on social media.

During a student conduct panel, the woman was aggressively cross-examined by Hardin's private attorneys when she didn't have a lawyer present, according to the lawsuit. No physical evidence was allowed because of the separate criminal trial against Hardin, it added. When the panel eventually cleared him, he winked at the woman as he walked by her, according to the suit.

Then, after reviewing the hearing process, college administrators reversed course and suspended Hardin from the campus grounds until his criminal case was resolved while still allowing him to take online classes. He unsuccessfully appealed that decision, but was allowed back at the school after he pleaded to the downgraded battery charge.

The woman's lawsuit against the university seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.

Marshall spokeswoman Leah Payne said Tuesday that Hardin is still enrolled and that the more recent charges didn't occur on campus and didn't involve the school's police department. The college also released a statement saying it is weighing disciplinary action against Hardin.

The newer charges of sexual assault against Hardin involve alleged rapes of two women last year in the same county where Marshall University is located, according to an indictment.

Marshall University is a public college with about 13,000 students located in Huntington near the West Virginia line with Kentucky."
"34","Ocala, FL - It was the mugshot that made national headlines; a drunk driver smiling for the camera after crashing and killing a Sarasota woman. Thursday, she learned her fate.

Facing a minimum of four years in prison, Judge Steven Rogers sentenced Angenette (Welk) Missett to 11 years for the death of 60-year-old Sandra Clarkston.

Clarkston died last May in the hospital in Ocala a few weeks after Missett slammed into her at a stop light, pushing her car into the back of a horse trailer.

Troopers say Missett's blood alcohol content was more than twice the legal limit.

Clarkston's family still has her smashed up car. They towed it to the courthouse Thursday for Missett’s sentencing.

Missett pleaded no contest to manslaughter then apologized to the family, including Clarkston’s fraternal twin brother, Daniel Clarkston, and Sandra's daughter.  

""I am truly, truly sorry and if I could change spots with your mother I would in a heartbeat. I am sorry. I am sorry. I am truly, truly sorry,"" Missett said before she was sentenced.

In a victim statement, Clarkston’s daughter told the court about the real consequences of Welk’s actions.

""I lost my only remaining parent because of the defendant's selfish and conscious decision to drink and drive,"" Clarkston’s daughter, Keonna Sciacca said in court.

A day before the sentencing, Clarkston's twin brother, Daniel said he is ready to look toward the future. 

""Whatever sentence he imposes on her, I'm OK with,"" Clarkston said. ""I'm not going to be vindictive about it because it's not going to bring her back. I'm fighting for my sister, my twin. She deserves it.""

While Thursday’s sentencing brought some closure to the Clarkston family, they say their fight isn't over. They plan to donate the smashed remains of the car hit by Missett to a high school in an effort to warn kids of the dangers of drinking and driving.

Até Dumas, 30, was arrested Saturday in connection with the attempted sexual assault at the park as well as an unrelated aggravated assault, according to NOPD. Dumas was booked on charges of attempted first-degree rape, aggravated assault, battery of a police officer and resisting arrest.

Officers responded to report of an attempted sexual assault in Audubon Park around 7 a.m. Saturday. A woman was trying to exit a restroom at the park when an unknown man attacked her, police said. The woman escaped her attacker and fled the area before calling police.

Boone County, KY - An 18-year-old former Covington Catholic basketball player has been indicted on rape and sodomy charges. Jacob Walter is locked up on $250,000 bond.

The alleged victim said she told him in December that she didn't want to have sex because she was sick. She said Walter forced her to have sex with him three times, pulled her hair and choked her. She told police he laughed when she said he was hurting her.

During a court appearance in December, Walter's attorney asked that his bond be reduced. The judge denied that request, citing the severity of the charges.

This is the second time Walter has been charged with rape. He was charged as a juvenile last May.

The girl is “doing fine,” Sheriff Tommy Jones of Monroe County, Tennessee, said Thursday.

Randall Pruitt, who adopted the girl, was arrested Thursday in Tennessee and charged with rape, the sheriff said. “(The girl) would be the victim in that,” Jones said.

All three reports were made Monday for incidents that occurred at South Russell Residence Hall on Dec. 2, Jan. 19 and Jan. 20, according to the Baylor Campus Crime and Fire Log. The reports involved the same individuals and are believed to be connected, leading the Campus Security Authorities to refer the cases to the Title IX office, which investigates sexual violence and harassment.

Baylor spokeswoman Tonya Hudson said the three incidents are currently under the Title IX jurisdiction, and all information regarding the case is confidential. It was unknown if the three reported incidents are also under criminal investigation, she said.

The crime log states a Title IX office inquiry is when an incident was reported to the Title IX office, but has not been reported to the police department.

A letter from the university was sent to South Russell residents Thursday saying the rape allegations occurred among the same individuals. The letter states that the school “assessed the threat and addressed the situation according to our established policies and procedures.”

“We take these allegations very seriously, and our firm commitment to our students is to ensure the safety and security of our campus community,” the letter states.

A student can report a sexual assault of any kind to the Title IX office and forgo a criminal investigation, authorities said. It is up to the student whether to pursue criminal charges or seek administrative action enforced by the school pending the completion of a Title IX investigation."

"57","Martinez, CA  — The trial wrapped up Tuesday for an Antioch man accused of torturing his underage ex-girlfriend for days on end after he discovered she had returned to prostitution.

Joel Tolbert, 22, was 18 years old in January 2015 when he was arrested and charged with torture, forced sodomy and forced oral copulation. His trial began last week, after four years of delays. Prosecutors say Tolbert went into a rage after learning his girlfriend had been involved in sex trafficking, and for three days beat, burned and sexually assaulted her.

The nightmarish experience ended, prosecutors say, because several friends of the victim, known in court records as Jane Doe, eventually realized what was going on and snuck her out of the Shelter Cove residence to safety.

The defense argued Tuesday that Doe was using Tolbert as a scapegoat and that someone else had injured her. The assaults allegedly happened at three locations — Dallas Ranch Middle School, a residence on Shelter Cove Court and an abandoned house a short distance away, but Doe has made inconsistent statements about where each event took place.

In order to prove the torture count, prosecutors must prove that Tolbert assaulted her with the specific intent to cause pain.

Speaking to jurors Tuesday morning, Deputy District Attorney Kabu Adodoadji said Tolbert was “upset that he could not control every aspect of the victim’s sexuality,” and sought to punish her. She showed jurors pictures of a curling iron Tolbert allegedly used to burn the girl, as well as a photo of blistered burn marks on her hand.

“She wasn’t hysterical. She wasn’t sobbing. There was that slow buildup of tears swelling in her eyes,” Adodoadji said of Doe’s testimony during trial. “That’s not something you can fake. That was entirely genuine.”

But Tolbert’s attorney, Howard Williams, told jurors all prosecutors had proved was that Doe had been injured, not who inflicted the injuries.

“You get a different story every time,” Williams said. He later added, “Mr. Adodoadji wants you to look at her statement and disregard the fact that she admitted lying to the police.”

Williams asked the jury to recount memories of traumatic incidents they had witnessed and asked them if key details, such as the location, were difficult to remember. As an example, Williams told jurors of a time he had wrecked his mother’s car at age 17.

“I’ll never forget that … those kinds of memories stay the same,” Williams said, adding that he could remember the exact location, the color of the car he struck and how the accident occurred.

“If I had lied to the police, I wouldn’t be able to do that,” he said.

But Adodoadji told jurors that inconsistencies between Doe’s statements to police were immaterial. He pointed out that after she came forward to authorities, Doe had to undergo an intrusive rape test, as well as multiple police interviews and court testimony where she was asked personal, embarrassing questions, including about her sex life.

“You have to ask yourself whether someone who is making this up would be willing to go through all that,” Adodoadji said. “Who goes through all that unless they’re telling the truth?”

Jurors began deliberating Tuesday afternoon and will continue Wednesday morning."
"58","Denver, CO  – Prosecutors have charged a 50-year-old man with sexually assaulting four women over the past two years – often allegedly taking advantage of them while they were intoxicated and leaving bars in the LoDo area of Denver.

Byron L. Whitehorn, 50, is charged with four counts of sex assault – overcoming victim’s will and four counts of sex assault – victim incapable. All eight counts are class 4 felonies.

According to an affidavit for his arrest, Whitehorn sexually assaulted a Lakewood woman in the early-morning hours of Dec. 15 after the woman tried to go home from the Ginn Mill bar on Larimer Street.

Whitehorn approached the woman as she waited for an Uber ride, took the woman’s phone and canceled the ride. He then took her to his car, which was parked in a nearby parking garage, and sexually assaulted her, the affidavit says.

After allegedly doing so, Whitehorn then drove the woman to her home in Lakewood, put his number in her phone as “Byron” and told her: “Let’s do this again,” according to the affidavit.

The woman reported to friends that she had been sexually assaulted and also reported the assault to police, who noticed a pattern with three other unsolved sexual assaults that were linked to the same person.

The Lakewood woman underwent a sex assault exam, which showed that the man who assaulted her carried the same DNA as the assailant in the other cases, according to the affidavit.

Officers were able to get in touch with Whitehorn because he had given his phone number to the woman. He agreed to provide his DNA through Buccal swabs after denying that he assaulted any women.

The DNA matched that from the other three cases, DPD Crime Lab analysts found, and the victim and several others were able to provide partial descriptions of Whitehorn’s vehicle: a white 2005 Audi A4 sedan with tan seats.

Officers met with the woman earlier this month to show her a photo array, during which she identified Whitehorn as the suspect.

Police then went back through the three other cases to which Whitehorn’s DNA matched.
A Boulder woman who was assaulted in January 2018 after leaving LoDo’s bar positively identified Whitehorn as the suspect in her assault, as did a witness.

A Canadian woman who was assaulted after leaving Jackson’s bar in October 2017 was unable to positively identify Whitehorn through a photo array. And a woman assaulted after leaving LoDo’s in April 2017 was also unable to positively identify Whitehorn in a photo lineup earlier this month.

Court records indicate Whitehorn had a $500,000 bond set in the case and that he has a preliminary hearing scheduled for Feb. 26.

Police are asking anyone who thinks they might also have been a victim of Whitehorn's to call 720-913-2000."

New recordings and documents are being released in the wake of Jayce Martin's death last July.

Police have said he was tortured by his mother, Victoria Toth, and her boyfriend, Jonathan Pursglove.

Jayce Martin was just two years old when the medical examiner said he died of severe physical trauma, as if he was repeatedly punched.

It happened inside the home he shared with his mother and her boyfriend, officials said.

Now, six months after Jayce's death, the State Attorney's Office is releasing a recorded conversation with Pursglove, in which he said, Toth was the last person alone with her son.

""I saw her carry him into the room, and I heard her, and she said, 'Jonathan! Jonathan! Oh my God,' and I said, 'What?' And I jumped up and I thought he was maybe throwing up again,"" Pursglove said. ""And I ran to the bathroom and at that point she had already had him down on the floor at that point, and I realized as she was saying, 'Jayce, Jayce,' and she looked at me and said, 'What do we do?' And I said, 'I don't know,' so I started doing CPR because he wasn't breathing.""

Pursglove told police Jayce appeared to be sick, for several days before his death, and recalled a trip to a local park.

""I thought he might have been dehydrated because it's been so hot. Yeah,"" he said. ""We went to that park and I just remember that he didn't want to play. You know, he didn't want to do anything. He didn't want to play.""

Pursglove and Toth are charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child.

Pursglove and Toth will now be tried later, rather than sooner. On Tuesday during a pre-trial hearing at the courthouse, the judge moved the trial back to July.

In an interview with police, Toth was asked numerous times to implicate Pursglove, but records show she would not do so."

Debra Wensman, 50, and Doris Wensman, 46, of Greencreek, were arrested Thursday after allegedly offering to give an undercover officer money, guns and ammunition to kill their neighbor, Ed Stubbers, The Lewiston Tribune reported.

Ryan Mader was delivering fuel to the sisters Tuesday when they confronted him and accused him of stalking them, the newspaper reported, citing a probable cause affidavit. Officials said the sisters were paranoid that people were trying to bankrupt them so they'd lose their farm and they appeared to believe Mader was part of the plot.

But then, somehow, the conversation allegedly turned to the sisters offering Mader guns, ammunition and $5,000 to kill Stubbers. The sisters told Mader they had tried in the past to hire someone to kill Stubbers, but never went through with it, The Lewiston Tribune reported. Mader told his employer about the encounter, and Mader's boss went to the cops.

On Thursday, deputy Sam AuGello, working undercover, drove to the Wensman’s property. The sisters, who reportedly said their house was bugged, allegedly began to discuss the murder-for-hire plot with the stranger and offered him $ 1,500, guns and ammo to kill their neighbor. They even gave the deputy a loaded handgun as an “act of good faith,” according to The Lewiston Tribune. The sisters allegedly told AuGello they had to go the bank to withdraw the money for the job. When they came back, police were waiting.

It's not clear what motive the sisters had for wanting Stubbers dead. One person from the area told The Daily Beast the sisters may have felt harassed by the surrounding residents. A former neighbor told the outlet the sisters were “super-nice ladies.”

Luis Arteaga was arrested Saturday and is being held on a $30,000 bond.

Police say he kidnapped a woman outside The Gold Club on North White Station Road last Saturday, drove her to another parking lot, raped her, and stole her purse and cell phone.

“It’s to the point nowadays where women can’t – we can’t do anything without having to be concerned with somebody doing something like this. And it’s appalling. It’s appalling,"" said Brandy McBroom, who lives nearby.

Court records show the victim was drunk and had fallen asleep in the passenger seat of her car in the club’s parking lot.

She says she woke up in another parking lot with Arteaga on top of her. Her cries and screams scared him off, and she drove back to the club and called police.

For McBroom, the fact that an accused rapist was walking the streets for a week before being caught is a terrifying wake-up call.

“He could have been walking around my neighborhood. I could have been taking my garbage out or coming up here to the store,"" she said. ""It could have just as easily happened to me or you or anybody else.""

Another woman WREG spoke to said she saw the crime scene that night while she was getting gas across the street.

“They [police] had it all wrapped up and I didn’t know what was going on,"" she said. “I noticed they had all the dancers not coming out ‘til the next day.”

According to the arrest affidavit, the victim told police she couldn’t remember what Arteaga looked like or exactly what happened because she was drunk.

And he might have gotten away with it if not for the surveillance cameras outside the club – and one major mistake.

Investigators say those cameras captured Arteaga getting into the victim’s car. And then Saturday, he showed back up to the scene of the crime, and that’s when management called detectives.

“The world we live in today, it’s just amazing to me how people think they can get away with these sort of things,"" McBroom said. ""I mean, we have cameras everywhere. Everywhere. So, I mean, he had to know he was gonna get caught.”

Police say Arteaga waived his rights and gave a written statement, admitting to getting into the victim’s car and driving her to an unknown location, but insisting the sex was consensual.

"68","Charleston, SC — Reality television star Thomas Ravenel was arrested Thursday after a former nanny said he fondled her at his South Carolina home featured in his TV show “Southern Charm” nearly four years ago.

Ravenel, 56, was charged with misdemeanor second-degree assault and battery, according to a sworn statement from Charleston Police which said they had photos of the injuries caused when the woman’s underwire bra cut into her chest and her shirt got caught around her neck as Ravenel tried to forcibly take off her clothes.

Bravo released a statement shortly after saying Ravenel would no longer appear on the network’s “Southern Charm” show.

Ravenel is already a felon. He was arrested in 2007 less than a year into his term as South Carolina treasurer after he bought cocaine for himself and his friends. The real estate developer pleaded guilty and spent 10 months in prison.

In 2014, Ravenel pleaded guilty to driving under the influence in Long Island, New York, resulting in his license being suspended for six months.

The former nanny said she was in Ravenel’s Charleston home in January 2015 when he took off her pants and fondled her, according to the sworn statement.

The woman also said Ravenel put his penis in her face and made vulgar comments, according to the affidavit.

She immediately called her family and pictures were taken of her injuries, police said.

“It has affected me every single day since he has done this. It’s not a situation where someone wins or loses. We all lost,” the nanny said in court, according to The Post and Courier of Charleston.

Ravenel and his lawyer didn’t comment on the charge as he was released on his own recognizance after the bond hearing, media outlets reported. He faces up to three years in prison if convicted.

Ravenel was an original primary cast member of “Southern Charm,” which followed the love-lives, booze-filled partying and careers — or lack thereof — of about a half-dozen Charleston socialites, as well as a wider circle of friends who became recurring characters.

Ravenel’s courtship, relationship, acrimonious breakup and custody issues with the mother of his two children formed a central story line over multiple seasons. His opulent homes were a frequent backdrop for the show as he hosted parties and polo matches."

"72","Murrieta, CA — Riverside County prosecutors Friday dropped all sexual assault charges against a convicted rapist who had been accused of repeatedly molesting two sisters in the Murrieta area, extracting a plea from him instead on a lesser count and saying the case could not go forward based on doubts about the strength of the evidence.

Michael James Camilleri, 42, of Winchester was arrested in March following a sheriff's investigation that led to the two alleged victims, neither of whom were identified, making allegations against the ex-convict.

Camilleri was ultimately charged with three counts of rape, 11 counts of lewd acts on a child and one count of violating sex registrant parole terms, with numerous sentence-enhancing allegations of preying on multiple victims.

Moments after Camilleri's case went before Superior Court Judge John Davis for a preliminary hearing at the Southwest Justice Center in Murrieta Friday morning, the prosecution and defense announced that a plea agreement had been reached, under which Camilleri admitted a felony charge of failure to comply with convicted sex offender registration terms.

All other counts were dismissed at the request of the District Attorney's Office.

Davis sentenced Camilleri to a year in county jail and three years probation.

""We determined that we did not believe we would be able to prove the dismissed counts beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury,"" District Attorney's Office Public Information Officer John Hall told City News Service.

Hall declined to provide specifics, including whether the victims had changed their stories. Defense attorney Suzanne Ferguson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Sheriff's officials said in March that a woman called deputies alleging that her ex-boyfriend -- Camilleri -- had molested her pre-teen daughter on several occasions in the preceding two years.

The woman, who was not identified, alleged that the assaults occurred while she resided in the 31000 block of Jan Steen Court in French Valley.

While detectives were gathering information, the victim's sister -- now 23 years old -- alleged that she, too, had been sexually assaulted by the defendant during encounters with him at a Murrieta residence several years earlier, according to the sheriff's department.

Detectives found and interviewed the convicted felon in Colton, where he was taken into custody without a struggle.

According to court records, Camilleri has a 1997 conviction for sexual assault on a minor, for which he served two years in state prison and was ordered to register as a sex offender.

Under California Penal Code section 290, sex registrants are required to keep a current address on file with law enforcement and notify authorities whenever they relocate. They're also generally prohibited from loitering where children gather and working in jobs that would involve routine contact with minors."
